# Twitter-Scraper

This project uses Selenium and Chrome webdriver to scrape tweets and other info from Twitter. The tweets are stored in dataframes and analyzed through histograms and scatterplots. Regression lines and correlation between number of likes, retweets, replies, and length are calculated. We also implemented code to display which user tweeted about the topic the most in our data and searched tweets that contained bad words.

Furthermore, we also had a list of bad / fake news websites and a list of prominent news websites and compared the tweets to them. From there we drew the summary for how many URLs were in our data, how many referenced bad websites and how many referenced prominent ones.
